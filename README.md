#                                                         Rupert Pople - Backend Developer

I am an a back software developer with a highly diverse professional background, including running my own online business for 3 years. As I was always naturally drawn to learning software and have a highly analytical mindset, I decided that coding would be a well suited path. I have just completed [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), an intensive coding bootcamp and loved every second of it. I am now spending my time creating trading algorithms and thoroughly enjoy working with large datasets in Python, Numpy and Pandas.

Having found what I am truely passionate about, I wish to develop and grow as a coder engaged in logic and data. My priority is to learn as much as I can.

### <a name="skills">My Strengths</a>

- **Adaptable learner** - I have an ability to learn and develop my skills to a high standard. I created and ran a successful affiliate website for 3 years, where self teaching was crucial. Throughout this journey I learnt how to do SEO, going from no knowledge to ranking first for competitive and profitable keywords. The resourcefulness and ability to self learn that was developed has been critical to accelerating the development of my coding skillset. I self identify as a learner and knowing I can always grow is what drives me.
- **Self driven & reliable** - The process of running my own business and developing the skills to assist it succeed required self discipline. I was always able to rely on myself to do what was required to go above and beyond. This was especially useful during the final group project (called Seedle) when we had ten working days to create a web app from scratch. In order to deliver the best we could, it was essential to work around the clock both inside and outside of our expected hours.
- **Calm approach** - When the coding gets tough, I can keep a level head. My mindfulness practice helps me keep a cool, balanced and forgiving head. When the codebase gets larger, there is more at stake when something goes wrong and being able to manage the psychological element of software development is crucial. I am finding this now with my personal trading project, but ultimately I know I can jump each hurdle.
- **Organized and punctual**  - I always think ahead and have a strong awareness of deadlines. Throughout my learning I always try to position myself slightly ahead of the schedule. This was particularly true during my degree where I would be sure to complete coursework assignments as soon as they were avaialable, rather than waiting till the end of term.
- **Communicator** - I don't shy away from asking for help where necessary and happy to provide it in return. This was a mantra that was solidified at Makers, as they encourage us to build a collaborative cohort mentality from the start. Everyday we paired with others, as well as worked together in multiple team projects. Although not as much of a focus compared to the technical skills developed, this element of the course as been as transformative.
