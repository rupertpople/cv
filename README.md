# Rupert Pople

I am an aspiring backend software developer with a highly diverse professional background, including running my own online business for 3 years. As I was always naturally drawn to learning software and have a highly analytical mindset, I decided that coding would be a well suited path. I have just completed [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), an intensive coding bootcamp and loved every second of it. I am now spending my time creating trading algorithms and thoroughly enjoy working with large datasets in Python, Numpy and Pandas.

Having found what I am truely passionate about, I wish to develop and grow as a coder engaged in logic and data. My priority is to learn as much as I can.

### <a name="skills">My Strengths</a>

- **Adaptable learner** - I have an ability to learn and develop my skills to a high standard. I created and ran a successful affiliate website for 3 years, where self teaching was crucial. Throughout this journey I learnt how to do SEO, going from no knowledge to ranking first for competitive and profitable keywords.
- **Self identify as a learner** - Knowing I can never know everything is what drives me. My mind is curious and always waiting to be challenged.
- **Self driven & reliable** - The process of running my own business and developing the skills to assist it succeed required self discipline. I was always able to rely on myself to do what was required to go above and beyond.
- **Calm approach** - When the coding gets tough, I can keep a level head. My mindfulness practice helps me keep a cool, balanced and forgiving head.
- **Organized and punctual**  - I always think ahead and have a strong awareness of deadlines. Throughout my learning I always try to position myself slightly ahead of the schedule.
- **Communicator** - I don't shy away from asking for help where necessary and happy to provide it in return.
